  - Projects
    - **Security-related project on ARM TrustZone**
      - Developed an Android application with realtime face recognition to demonstrate the practical usage of our proposed security mechanism for ARM TrustZone.
      - Optimized the initial Android application significantly by using some optimization techniques (avoiding memory copy, multi-threading, asynchronous calls, etc) so that it can run faster on the ARM development board.
      - Programming Language/Framework used: C, Java, Python, Android, JNI
    - **Trusted execution environment (TEE) software project with Rust**
      - Redesigning OP-TEE (an implementation for TEE) storage system using Rust to ensure memory safety.
      - Verifying the Rust implementation by identifying safety properties (pre-conditions, post-conditions, invariants, etc).
      - Programming Language/Framework used: Rust, C, Coq, Prusti
